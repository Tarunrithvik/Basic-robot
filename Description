Basic bot created with Arduino IDE

We did this basic bot using ESP8266 module which can be controlled using Wi-Fi. We created a basic HTML page from which the bot can be controlled. It can do only the 4 basic motions. Forward, Backward, Turn Right, Turn Left. We used a motor driver to control the motion and direction of the motors.
