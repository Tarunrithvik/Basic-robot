We did this basic bot using an ESP8266 module, which can be controlled using Wi-Fi. 
We created a basic HTML page from which the bot can be controlled. 
It can do only the 4 basic motions: Forward, Backward, Turn Right, and Turn Left. 
We used a motor driver to control the motion and direction of the motors.
